# WaffleShop

## 1.Statement of the Work
Dessert Shop is a caf√© that sells waffles and drinks. When customers arrive at this cafe, they design the dessert they want according to the kinds of waffles, their ingredients and their prices. In addition, customers can order hot or cold beverages from the menu. The waitress delivers these orders to the cook from the customer. The cook is responsible for making the dessert and preparing the drink according to the order.

## 2.Proposed Pattern
Many design patterrns are applied for solving existing problems in the project. These design patterns are Command Pattern, Simple Factory Pattern, Template Method Pattern and Decorator Pattern.

Firstly, customers create a dessert (Dessert Order) or beverage (Beverage Order) order and the waitress (Invoker) delivers these orders to the cook (Receiver). The cook works with Dessert Factory for dessert and with Beverage Factory for beverage. To do this, the cook uses makeWaffle() and makeBeverage() methods (Simple Factory Pattern).

Dessert Factory create dessert and to do this create Dessert interface. There are two kinds of waffles such as Circular and Square in Dessert Shop and these dessert types implement Dessert interface. The customers had chosen dessert ingredients according to the dessert they had previously wanted. The dessert is decorated according to these dessert ingredients (Decorator Pattern). There are 3 Decorator classes for dessert decoration such as Chocolate Decorator, Fruit Decorator and Condiment Decorator. Cost of the dessert is calculated according to decoration ingredients. 

Finally, Beverage Factory is responsible for hot and cold beverages creation and creates Beverage interface. Hot Beverage and Cold Beverage classes implement this interface. Subclasses such as tea, coffee, cola etc. extend these classes. The distinction between them is the difference in the preparation of hot and cold beverages (Template Method Pattern). Also, there are some differences in subclasses. Finally, hook() is used for each beverage and the customer is asked if some extra condiments are wanted.
